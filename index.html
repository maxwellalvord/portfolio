      <p>My name is Maxwell Powers Alvord and I grew up in Portland Oregon. I love to go to the mountain and ski as well as play lacrosse with my friends. My free time at home is spent cuddling with my dog and watching ominous tv shows. A secret skill I have is that I can wake up with no alarm, essentailly at any time I want.

      <p>From 2018 to 2020 I attended Montana State University until covid closures. My job experience with coding is none as this program will hopefully be the cataylst I need to learn skills relevant to the job market. I love algorithms and puzzles as well as computers and technology so I am in the class because my passion is to be paid to create in mediums I enjoy. </p>
